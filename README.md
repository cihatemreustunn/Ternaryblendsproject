# Ternary blends

This repository consists of the ML models and the traning dataset used in the following study:

Üstün, Cihat Emre, et al. "Data-Driven Prediction of Laminar Burning Velocity for Ternary Ammonia/Hydrogen/Methane/Air Premixed Flames." Hydrogen/Methane/Air Premixed Flames.

The Jupyter notebook rigoriously explains the model construction and assessment. It can be used to create models using new a dataset for any sort of fuel mixtures. The models can be used standalone or ensembled to obtain final predictions.
